## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- A key takeaway from this project is that whenver I'm using flex, try to wrap image type flex items in a div, else espect some discrepancy between what will be displayed in firefox vs chrome.

```html
<article class="hero-image">
  <img class="mockup" src="images/illustration-mockups.svg" alt="mockup" />
</article>
```

- Also I discovered I couldn't add a box shadow to my button whenever I used mix-blend-mode on it.
